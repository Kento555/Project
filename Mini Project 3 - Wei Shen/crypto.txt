A '''cryptocurrency''', '''crypto-currency''', or '''crypto''' is a collection of binary data which is designed to work as a [[medium of exchange]] wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a [[ledger]] which is a computerized [[database]] using [[strong cryptography]] to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership.<ref name="crypto currency">{{Cite news |last=Andy Greenberg |date=20 April 2011 |title=Crypto Currency |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0509/technology-psilocybin-bitcoins-gavin-andresen-crypto-currency.html |url-status=live |access-date=8 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831001109/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0509/technology-psilocybin-bitcoins-gavin-andresen-crypto-currency.html |archive-date=31 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="reuterspricing">{{Cite news |last=Polansek |first=Tom |date=2 May 2016 |title=CME, ICE prepare pricing data that could boost bitcoin |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cme-group-bitcoin-idUSKCN0XT1G1 |access-date=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pernice|first1=Ingolf G.

In 1983, the American cryptographer [[David Chaum]] conceived an anonymous cryptographic [[electronic money]] called [[ecash]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034712/http://www.hit.bme.hu/%7Ebuttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF |archive-date=18 December 2014 |access-date=26 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://blog.koehntopp.de/uploads/chaum_fiat_naor_ecash.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903023027/http://blog.koehntopp.de/uploads/chaum_fiat_naor_ecash.pdf |archive-date=3 September 2011 |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Later, in 1995, he implemented it through [[Digicash]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pitta |first=Julie |title=Requiem for a Bright Idea |website=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411390a.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830214226/https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411390a.html |archive-date=30 August 2017 |access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref> an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party.

In 1996, the [[National Security Agency]] published a paper entitled ''How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash'', describing a Cryptocurrency system, first publishing it in an MIT mailing list<ref>{{Cite web |title=How To Make A Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026230354/http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/money/nsamint/nsamint.htm |archive-date=26 October 2017 |access-date=11 January 2018 |website=groups.csail.mit.edu}}</ref> and later in 1997, in ''The American Law Review'' (Vol. 46, Issue 4).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Law |first1=Laurie |last2=Sabett |first2=Susan |last3=Solinas |first3=Jerry |date=11 January 1997 |title=How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash |url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/aulr/vol46/iss4/6/ |url-status=live |journal=American University Law Review |volume=46 |issue=4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112043050/http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/aulr/vol46/iss4/6/ |archive-date=12 January 2018 |access-date=11 January 2018}}</ref>

In 2009, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created by presumably pseudonymous developer [[Satoshi Nakamoto]]. It used [[SHA-256]], a cryptographic hash function, in its [[proof-of-work]] scheme.<ref name="primer" /><ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039184/bitcoin-developer-talks-regulation-open-source-and-the-elusive-satoshi-nakamoto.html Bitcoin developer chats about regulation, open source, and the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003104345/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2039184/bitcoin-developer-talks-regulation-open-source-and-the-elusive-satoshi-nakamoto.html |date=3 October 2014 }}, PCWorld, 26 May 2013</ref> In April 2011, [[Namecoin]] was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized [[domain name system|DNS]], which would make [[internet censorship]] very difficult.

==Formal definition==
According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lansky |first=Jan |date=January 2018 |title=Possible State Approaches to Cryptocurrencies |url=http://si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/article/viewFile/335/325 |url-status=live |journal=Journal of Systems Integration |volume=9/1 |pages=19–31 |doi=10.20470/jsi.v9i1.335 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212005102/http://si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/article/viewFile/335/325 |archive-date=12 February 2018 |access-date=11 February 2018 |doi-access=free}}</ref>
# The system does not require a central authority; its state is maintained through distributed consensus.
# The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.
# The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.
# Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively [[cryptographically]].
# The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.
# If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.

Altcoins often have underlying differences with bitcoin.

==Architecture==
Decentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US [[Federal Reserve System]], corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency. In the case of decentralized cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which decentralized cryptocurrencies are based was created by the group or individual known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]].<ref name="te20151031">{{Cite news |date=31 October 2015 |title=Blockchains: The great chain of being sure about things |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable |url-status=live |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703000844/http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21677228-technology-behind-bitcoin-lets-people-who-do-not-know-or-trust-each-other-build-dependable |archive-date=3 July 2016 |access-date=18 June 2016}}</ref>

[[Decentralized]] consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.<ref name="decapp">{{Cite book |last=Raval |first=Siraj |url={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}} |title=Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4919-2452-5|pages=[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page=1|plainurl=yes}} 1]–[{{google books |chapter=What Is a Decentralized Application? |oclc=968277125 |access-date=6 November 2016 |chapter-url={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page=1|plainurl=yes}} |via=Google Books |fvywDAAAQBAJ |plainurl=yes}} 2]}}</ref>

=== Nodes ===
In the world of Cryptocurrency, a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. The node supports the relevant cryptocurrency's network through either; relaying transactions, validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain. In terms of relaying transactions each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports, when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.

Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organisation or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those that are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914098|title = Nodes in the Bitcoin Network: Comparative Measurement Study and Survey|year = 2019|last1 = Park|first1 = Sehyun|last2 = Im|first2 = Seongwon|last3 = Seol|first3 = Youhwan|last4 = Paek|first4 = Jeongyeup|journal = IEEE Access|volume = 7|pages = 57009–57022|s2cid = 155106629}}</ref>

====Timestamping====
Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to "prove" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.

The first timestamping scheme invented was the [[Proof of work|proof-of-work]] scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and [[scrypt]].<ref name="ars1" />

Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include [[CryptoNote#Egalitarian proof of work|CryptoNight]], [[BLAKE (hash function)|Blake]], [[SHA-3]], and [[Dash (cryptocurrency)#X11|X11]].

The [[Proof of stake|proof-of-stake]] is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.<ref name="ars1" />

===Mining===
[[File:Оборудование HashCoins.jpg|thumb|Hashcoin [[Bitcoin network#Mining|mine]] ]]
In cryptocurrency networks, ''mining'' is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases [[#Transaction fees|transaction fees]] by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]s and [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and [[scrypt]].<ref name=computer201709>{{Cite magazine|title=The Evolution of Bitcoin Hardware|date=2017-09-01|magazine=Computer|url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2017/09/mco2017090058/13rRUwghdcJ|last=Bedford Taylor|first=Michael}}</ref> This [[arms race]] for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since the day the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was introduced in 2009.<ref name=computer201709 /> With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for this validation has become far more complex over the years, with miners having to invest large sums of money on employing multiple high performance ASICs. Thus the value of the currency obtained for finding a hash often does not justify the amount of money spent on setting up the machines, the cooling facilities to overcome the heat they produce, and the electricity required to run them.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hern |first=Alex |date=17 January 2018 |title=Bitcoin's energy usage is huge – we can't afford to ignore it |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency |url-status=live |access-date=23 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123061505/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency |archive-date=23 January 2018}}</ref> Favorite regions for mining include those with cheap electricity, a cold climate, and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations. {{as of|2019|7}}, bitcoin's electricity consumption is estimated to about 7 gigawatts, 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to that of Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baraniuk |first=Chris |date=3 July 2019 |title=Bitcoin's global energy use 'equals Switzerland' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48853230 |access-date=2 February 2020 |website=BBC News}}</ref>

Some [[Mining pool|miners pool resources]], sharing their [[computer performance|processing power]] over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a [[blockchain (database)|block]]. A "share" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.

{{Main|Cryptocurrency wallet}}
A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] stores the [[Public-key cryptography|public and private "keys"]] (address) or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Arnott|first=Amy|date=August 2, 2021|title=A Basic Glossary of Terms for Crypto Newbies|url=https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1050329/a-basic-glossary-of-terms-for-crypto-newbies|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-30|website=Morningstar.com|language=en}}</ref> With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.

There exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet from using paper wallets which are traditional public, private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are dedicated hardware to securely store your wallet information, using a digital wallet which is a computer with a software hosting your wallet information, hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded. or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.5937/ekonomika1903065J|title=Comparative analysis of cryptocurrency wallets vs traditional wallets|year=2019|last1=Jokić|first1=Stevo|last2=Cvetković|first2=Aleksandar|last3=Adamović|first3=Saša|last4=Ristić|first4=Nenad|last5=Spalević|first5=Petar|journal=Ekonomika|volume=65|issue=3|pages=65–75|s2cid=208267171}}</ref>

==Economics==
Cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside existing banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.

===Block rewards===
Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.<ref>{{Cite web |title=On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward |url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref>

The rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. The verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power, and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate public blockchain. Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they further must consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution. Generally, the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs, but this may not always be the case.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Price Fluctuations and the Use of Bitcoin: An Empirical Inquiry |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/conferences/shared/pdf/retpaym_150604/polasik_paper.pdf |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref>

The current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities. Some sources claim that the current bitcoin design is very inefficient, generating a welfare loss of 1.4% relative to an efficient cash system. The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 Million per year. This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment. However, the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. Another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Economics of Cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin and Beyond |url=https://www.bis.org/events/eopix_1810/chiu_paper.pdf |access-date=5 May 2020}}</ref>

===Transaction fees===
Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the [[supply and demand|supply]] of network capacity at the time, versus the [[supply and demand|demand]] from the currency holder for a faster transaction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

For [[ether (cryptocurrency)|ether]], transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses [[SegWit]]. In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.017,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=https://ethgasstation.info/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026064457/https://ethgasstation.info/ |archive-date=26 October 2018 |access-date=25 October 2018}}</ref> while for bitcoin it corresponded to $0.55.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bitcoin Avg.

===Initial coin offerings===
An [[initial coin offering]] (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an "investment contract" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of "tokens") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or ether.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Commission |first=Ontario Securities |title=CSA Staff Notice 46-307 Cryptocurrency Offerings |url=http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/SecuritiesLaw_csa_20170824_cryptocurrency-offerings.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929101456/http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/en/SecuritiesLaw_csa_20170824_cryptocurrency-offerings.htm |archive-date=29 September 2017 |access-date=20 January 2018 |website=Ontario Securities Commission}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=SEC Issues Investigative Report Concluding DAO Tokens, a Digital Asset, Were Securities |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010022343/https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131 |archive-date=10 October 2017 |access-date=20 January 2018 |website=sec.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Company Halts ICO After SEC Raises Registration Concerns |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-227 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119192823/https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-227 |archive-date=19 January 2018 |access-date=20 January 2018 |website=sec.gov}}</ref>

According to [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used [[Switzerland]] as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations. The Swiss regulatory agency [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|FINMA]] stated that it would take a "balanced approach" to ICO projects and would allow "legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system." In response to numerous requests by industry representatives, a legislative ICO working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018, which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices.<ref>R Atkins (Feb. 2018).

== Trends ==
The "market cap" of any coin is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation. The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by Bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as block chain rewards coded into the architecture technology of Bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the "halving", which is when the block rewards received from Bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into Bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of Bitcoin. As the date reaches near of an halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Meynkhard |first1=Artur |title=Fair market value of bitcoin: halving effect |journal=Investment Management and Financial Innovations |date=28 November 2019 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=72–85 |doi=10.21511/imfi.16(4).2019.07 |s2cid=212850773 }}</ref>

== Increased regulation in 2021 ==
The rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users. The [[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as "virtual asset service providers" (VASPs) and recommended that they be regulated with the same [[money laundering]] ([[Money laundering#Combating|AML]]) and [[know your customer]] (KYC) requirements as financial institutions.<ref>FATF (2019) "Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach to Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers. https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/guidance-rba-virtual-assets.html</ref>

In May 2020, the Joint Working Group on interVASP Messaging Standards published "IVMS 101", a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary information between VASPs. The FATF and financial regulators were informed as the data model was developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://intervasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IVMS101-interVASP-data-model-standard-issue-1-FINAL.pdf | title=interVASP Messaging Standards | website=www.intervasp.org/ |access-date=2021-10-13 | lang=en}}</ref>  

In June 2020, FATF updated its guidance to include the "Travel Rule" for cryptocurrencies, a measure which mandates that VASPs obtain, hold, and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/12-Month-Review-Revised-FATF-Standards-Virtual-Assets-VASPS.pdf | title=12-Month Review of the Revised FATF Standards on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers | website=www.fatf-gafi.org |access-date=2021-10-13 | lang=en}}</ref> Subsequent standardized protocol specifications recommended using [[JSON]] for relaying data between VASPs and identity services. As of December 2020, the IVMS 101 data model has yet to be finalized and ratified by the three global standard setting bodies that created it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tsc.bitcoinassociation.net/standards/travel-rule-specification/ | title=Travel Rule Specification - Bitcoin SV Technical Standards | website=tsc.bitcoinassociation.net | access-date=2021-10-13 | lang=en}}</ref>

The European Commission published a digital finance strategy in September 2020. This included a draft regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the EU.<ref>European Commission (2020) “Proposal for regulation of Markets in Crypto-assets, and amending Directive (EU) 2019/1937”, 24 September. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593&from=EN</ref><ref>Dirk A.

On 10 June 2021, The [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses. For instance, if a bank were to hold bitcoin worth $2 billion, it would be required to set aside enough capital to cover the entire $2 billion. This is a more extreme standard than banks are usually held to when it comes to other assets. However, this is a proposal and not a regulation.

Cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and [[Money laundering|launder money]]. Money laundering issues [[FinCEN Files|are also present in regular bank transfers]], however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account holder must at least [[Wire transfer#Security|provide a proven identity]].

Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.<ref name=":1" />

Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money. Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions.<ref name=":1" />

===Darknet markets===
{{Main|Darknet market}}
Properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of [[darknet market|online black markets]], such as [[Silk Road (marketplace)|Silk Road]].<ref name=":1" /> The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000.<ref name=":1" />

Darknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Cryptocurrency used in dark markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the U.S., bitcoins are labelled as "virtual assets".{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} This type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Raeesi |first=Reza |date=23 April 2015 |title=The Silk Road, Bitcoins and the Global Prohibition Regime on the International Trade in Illicit Drugs: Can this Storm Be Weathered? |url=http://gjis.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/gjis/article/view/38935 |url-status=live |journal=Glendon Journal of International Studies / Revue d'Études Internationales de Glendon |volume=8 |issue=1–2 |issn=2291-3920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222084405/http://gjis.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/gjis/article/view/38935 |archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=November 2019}}

This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets.<ref>[http://c4ss.org/content/25638 Keeping Your Cryptocurrency Safe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712235229/http://c4ss.org/content/25638 |date=12 July 2014 }}, Center for a Stateless Society, 1 April 2014</ref>

===Academic studies===
{{Main|Ledger (journal)}}
In September 2015, the establishment of the [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] ''[[Ledger (journal)|Ledger]]'' ({{ISSN|2379-5980}}) was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Introducing Ledger, the First Bitcoin-Only Academic Journal |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/introducing-ledger-the-first-bitcoin-only-academic-journal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110172807/http://motherboard.vice.com/read/introducing-ledger-the-first-bitcoin-only-academic-journal |archive-date=10 January 2017 |website=Motherboard}}</ref>

The journal encourages authors to [[Digital signature|digitally sign]] a [[Hash function|file hash]] of submitted papers, which will then be [[Trusted timestamping|timestamped]] into the bitcoin [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]]. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Editorial Policies |url=http://ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/about/editorialPolicies#custom-0 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223135741/http://www.ledgerjournal.org/ojs/index.php/ledger/about/editorialPolicies#custom-0 |archive-date=23 December 2016 |access-date=24 September 2015 |website=ledgerjournal.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |year=2015 |title=How to Write and Format an Article for Ledger |url=http://ledger.pitt.edu/ojs/public/journals/1/AuthorGuide.pdf |url-status=live |journal=[[Ledger (journal)|Ledger]] |doi=10.5195/LEDGER.2015.1 |doi-broken-date=31 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922190603/http://ledger.pitt.edu/ojs/public/journals/1/AuthorGuide.pdf |archive-date=22 September 2015}}</ref>

===Aid agencies===
A number of [[Aid agency|aid agencies]] have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including the [[American Red Cross]], [[UNICEF]],<ref name="ibtimesunicef">{{Cite news |last=Mendoza |first=Ron |date=14 October 2019 |title=UNICEF Blockchain Fund: First UN Organization To Accept Cryptocurrency Donations |work=IB Times] |url=https://www.ibtimes.com/unicef-blockchain-fund-first-un-organization-accept-cryptocurrency-donations-2845332 |access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref> and the [[UN World Food Program]].

Cryptocurrencies make tracking [[donation]]s easier and have the potential to allow donors to see how their money is used ([[financial transparency]]).

Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation said that UNICEF would uphold existing donor protocols, meaning that those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to UNICEF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-launches-cryptocurrency-fund|title=UNICEF launches Cryptocurrency Fund|website=www.unicef.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/09/unicef-now-accepting-donations-through-bitcoin-and-ether|title=Unicef now accepting donations through bitcoin and ether|date=9 October 2019|website=The Guardian}}</ref>
